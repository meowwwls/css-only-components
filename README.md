# CSS Only UI Components

These are just to demonstrate what can be done with CSS alone. These are not fully accessible, and not production-ready. These are simple demos and none of the code is ideal. There's a lot of room for improvement.


## Responsive Tabs with SVG Icons
Set for a max of 6 tabs, since more than 6 doesn't really work on mobile.

On mobile, the tabs have icons only. On medium to large screen, the tabs have icons and text.
